I’ve always been drawn to the power of data—how it tells stories, reveals patterns, and helps make smarter decisions. There's something truly exciting about diving into a dataset, refining insights with libraries like Pandas, and continuously learning how to make analysis more efficient. At the same time, my passion for digital law keeps me exploring the legal side of technology, understanding how data and legislation intersect in our ever-evolving digital world. It’s this mix of curiosity and problem-solving that drives me every day!
